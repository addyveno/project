            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>AquaThreads was founded in 2010 by visionary eco-entrepreneur Sarah Green in response to the growing need for sustainable fashion. Starting as a small workshop in Green City, AquaThreads focused on creating organic cotton t-shirts that were stylish, comfortable, and kind to the environment.</p>

Over the years, weâ€™ve grown from a local startup to a globally recognized brand, all while maintaining our mission to reduce water pollution and promote sustainable practices.

  Today, AquaThreads stands as a leader in the eco-fashion movement, using cutting-edge, water-saving production techniques and partnering with like-minded suppliers to make a positive impact on the planet. With every garment, we strive to inspire change and support a cleaner, greener future for generations to come.</p>
